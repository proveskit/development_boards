# development_boards
Miscellaneous dev boards to test the components of the PROVES Kit on a smaller scale. 

## flat_sat_dev_board
This board is intended to be a "FlatSat" stand in for all of the core hardware of the PROVES Kit! By putting all of the microcontrollers, sensors, and communications hardware on one convenient board you can carry it around with you where ever you'd like!

Find a link to the documentation for that [here](https://docs.proveskit.space/en/latest/core_documentation/hardware/flatsat_dev_board/)! 

## Camera_board_v2
This board is currently being developed for the Irvington High School Girls in STEM Club team, who are looking to fly a camera on Pleiades - Orpheus. 

## Mux_driver_board_v1
This board is a breakout hosting both the TCA I2C Multiplexer and an I2C based LED driver. It is intended to be mounted as a daughter card on another PCB and used to provide access to additional protected I2C buses. 

## FC_Advanced_Carrier 
This is the initial design for a board that is able to accept an NVIDIA Jetson Nano SoM.

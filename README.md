# development_boards
Miscellaneous dev boards to test the components of the PROVES Kit on a smaller scale. 

## flat_sat_dev_board
This board is intended to be a "FlatSat" stand in for all of the core hardware of the PROVES Kit! By putting all of the microcontrollers, sensors, and communications hardware on one convenient board you can carry it around with you where ever you'd like!

Find a link to the documentation for that [here](https://docs.proveskit.space/en/latest/core_documentation/hardware/flatsat_dev_board/)! 

## antenna_top_cap
ðŸš§UNDER CONSTRUCTIONðŸš§
This antenna top cap development board is intended to pair with the fligth controller development board, as this contains no microcontroller or microprocessor
## flight_controller_dev_board
ðŸš§UNDER CONSTRUCTIONðŸš§
This development board is intended to be a board that can be placed internally of the satellite and can even operate as a communications board for ground stations. With an included ethernet port, the future intentions for the board is to allow it to communicate over TCP with other satellite boards, and to allow the ground station application to upload downlinked data to the internet.
